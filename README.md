InvestmentHub is an app designed to help users analyze their investment portfolios. Once being authenticated and logging in, users can add specific stocks to their InvestmentHub portfolio. Users can then click the 'analyze' button, moving them to a dashboard that is designed for that specific stock, enabling the user to access four key areas of information :
1. An overview of company news and economic news that can influence the company's performance.
2. Providing insights into the three main sections of annual filings, helping users understand the business, key financial information and other pertinent information. 
3. Visualizing trend growth of revenue, costs, free cash flow and more over the past five years, giving a historical perspective on performance. 
4. Users can engage in one-on-one discussions to delve deeper into specific details of the filings. 

InvestmentHub is still under development.
